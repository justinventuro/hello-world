Practice
A 4th-year Mechatronics Engineering student at Ryerson University, focusing solely on courses and technical skills never captivated Justin. He is constantly looking for ways to step outside his comfort zone whether it is physically, mentally or spiritually. Having experience with entrepreneurship, case and design competitions, conference organization and technical work, Justin found his most enlightening experiences to be casual coffee chats. Having chatted with first-year students, athletes, influencers, Silicon Valley & Toronto entrepreneurs and even the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company, he learned the role one’s mindset plays in one’s life. This was what led him to Co-Founding Myndset. In his spare time, Justin is an avid fitness enthusiast and also enjoys snowboarding, sailing reading and practicing music.
